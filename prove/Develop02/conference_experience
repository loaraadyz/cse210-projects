PROMPT: What was the strongest emotion I felt today?
ENTRY: While I was delivering my talk this afternoon, I was moved as I share the story of my friend when he took courage in finding for her husband and be reconciled to him after 10 year so that she could be baptized and be sealed with her family despite of being broken for 10 years. I felt great faith and peace.

PROMPT: Who was the most interesting person I interacted with today?
ENTRY: The most interesting person that I interacted with is Elder Deyro. We had so much fun during his training. He's a good educator and teacher. I've also learned today how the new For the Strength of Youth was written focusing on Faith, Hope, Charity, Serving with Mind, Might, and Strength that we may find joy as we use it with our choices.
